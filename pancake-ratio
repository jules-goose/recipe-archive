flour weight : M*2
sugar weight : [0.10,0.25] * M or none

baking soda : 1-2 gr per ehh
mix liquid part together, beat eggs, mix dry part together then add liquid to dry 
*if you want them to be really leavened and soft , mix fat to flour instead of in liquid part (fat coat flour, reducing gluten development ,which in help leavening)
*if you like a pretzel like taste, add more baking soda
